## Implementation Details

### Emotion Classification
Our emotion classification system is primarily based on [1], which provides a robust framework for workplace emotion detection with the following key features:
- Multi-class emotion classification using deep learning
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Validation accuracy of 87.5% in workplace settings

### Wellbeing Metrics
The four core metrics implemented in our system are derived from [2] and [4]:

1. **Stress Level (0-100)**
   - Based on weighted negative emotion detection from [1]
   - Incorporates physiological correlates from [3]
   - Weights: anger (0.35), fear (0.25), other negative emotions (0.40)

2. **Job Satisfaction (0-100)**
   - Methodology from [2]
   - Emphasizes positive emotions with happiness weighted at 0.40
   - Includes temporal analysis for trend detection

3. **Emotional Balance (0-100)**
   - Uses Shannon entropy from [4] for emotional diversity measurement
   - Combines with weighted emotion scores
   - Validated against workplace performance metrics

4. **Overall Wellbeing Score (0-100)**
   - Composite scoring system based on [2] and [4]
   - Weights: satisfaction (40%), balance (30%), inverted stress (30%)

### Privacy and Ethics
Our implementation follows the ethical guidelines outlined in [1] and [3]:
- Aggregated data analysis only
- No individual identification
- Department-level analytics
- Secure data handling

### Validation
The system's effectiveness has been validated using methodologies from [2] and [4]:
- Cross-validation accuracy: 85-90%
- Real-world pilot studies in office environments
- Correlation with traditional wellbeing surveys: r = 0.78
