# Python Version Compatibility

This document outlines the Python version compatibility for the facial recognition project with federated learning and privacy features.

## Current Python Environment

Your current Python version is **3.12.6**

## Key Libraries Compatibility

| Library | Python 3.9 | Python 3.10 | Python 3.11 | Python 3.12 | Python 3.13 | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| TensorFlow | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (≥2.16.0) | ❌ | Python 3.12 support was added in TF 2.16.0 |
| TensorFlow Federated | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | Limited to Python <3.12, ≥3.9 |
| TensorFlow Privacy | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (≥0.8.0) | ❌ | Should follow TensorFlow compatibility |
| TenSEAL | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (≥0.3.15) | ✅ | Python 3.12-3.13 support added in v0.3.15+ |
| Pyfhel | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | Based on available documentation |
| OpenCV | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❓ | Generally stays compatible with current Python versions |
| MXNET | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❓ | ❌ | Limited recent updates |

## Recommendation

For this project, **Python 3.11** is recommended for the following reasons:

1. **Maximum compatibility**: All required libraries are fully supported in Python 3.11
2. **Stability**: Well-established support across the ecosystem
3. **Performance**: Python 3.11 offers significant performance improvements over 3.9/3.10

While Python 3.12 would work with some components, **TensorFlow Federated** (a critical component for the federated learning implementation) is not yet compatible with Python 3.12.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the recommended Python environment:

1. Install Python 3.11:
   ```bash
   # On Windows: Download from python.org or use winget
   winget install Python.Python.3.11
   
   # On Linux:
   sudo apt install python3.11 python3.11-venv
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python3.11 -m venv venv
   
   # Activate on Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Activate on Linux/macOS
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Library Version Constraints

Add the following constraints to your requirements.txt file:

```
tensorflow>=2.8.0,<3.0
tensorflow-federated>=0.34.0,<0.88.0
tensorflow-privacy>=0.7.3
tenseal>=0.3.15
pyfhel>=2.3.1
opencv-python>=4.5.5
```

## Notes for Future Compatibility

- Monitor TensorFlow Federated releases for Python 3.12 support
- Consider updating to Python 3.12 once TensorFlow Federated adds support
- Test the system thoroughly when upgrading Python versions
